#!/usr/bin/env python3

#  Create a program hello_all.py.
# • This program must be executable.
# • This program will contain a method called "hello". This method will display "Hello,
# everyone!".
# • After defining your method, you will test it by calling it in your program. Like in
# the example below, except that we have hidden the method definition.
# ?> cat hello_all.py
# # Your method definition
# hello()
# ?> ./hello_all.py
# Hello, everyone!
# ?>

def hello():
    print("Hello, everyone!")

hello()
